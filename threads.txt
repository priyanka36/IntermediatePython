Threads : An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "lightweight process")
A process can spawn multiple Threads

All threads within a process share the same memory
lightweight
Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
Great for I/O bound tasks


-Threading is limited by GIL:
-No effect on CPU bound tasks 
-Not interruptable and killable
-Careful with race conditions
-Race condition occurs when two or more threads try to modify the process at the same time.


GIL: Global Interpreter lock
-A lock that allows one thread at a time to execute in Python
-Use a different,free threaded Python implementation(Jython,IronPython)
-Use Python as a wrapper for third party libraries (C/C++) => numpy,scipy


In C python there is a technique called reference counting that is used for memory management .in python there is reference count varibale that 
keeps count of the refrences that point to the object
When the count reaches 0 the memory pointed by the object can be realeased
This reference variable needs protection from race conditions
It can cause leaked memory(never realeased)
Thats why GIL is implemented 
To not use GIL we use multiprocessing
