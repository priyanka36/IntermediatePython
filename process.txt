Process: An instance of a program(eg Python interpreter)

Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
Seperate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
Great for CPU bound processing
New process is started independently from other processes
Processes are interruptable/killable
One GIL for each process -> avoid GIL limitation

-HeavyWeight
-Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
-More memory
-IPC(Inter-process communication) is more complicated
